# Utilibot, Moderation Bot
This is an open-source project for Utilibot, a fully-featured moderation focused
bot for your [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) server. This repo is a rewrite
of the existing bot, which is currently closed source.

## Documentation
Documentation for the current, closed-source version
is available [here](https://lessis.moe/projects/utilibot), though
a local copy will be made available once this project progresses further.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions, but please follow the [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  
It is expected that you have an intermediate level of experience with both Node.js
and the Discord API in general.

You will need to set up a local instance of the serverConfig, audit, and member tables.
Full documentation for that will be coming soon(tm).

## Support
For support with the existing bot, or to get more information on the rewrite or its
current state of development, join the [support server](https://discord.gg/nZYtEyT) on
Discord.
